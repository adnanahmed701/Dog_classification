# Dog_classification
A deep learning project using Tensorflow and Keras.  We'll read in a dataset of dog images, then train a convolutional neural network to classify them by breed.


## File overview:

* `classifier.ipynb` - a Jupyter notebook that loads the images and trains a neural network.

## Data

* [dog_images.zip](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1sj62C-9WKD09-8iYSeEvXmAGQoY2oFFQ) 

The data is originally from [Stanford](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).
